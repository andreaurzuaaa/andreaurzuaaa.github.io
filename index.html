  <h2>Bio</h2>
  <p>I am a Bay Area–based musician with over 10 years of experience performing and creating music. I have played at venues and events throughout the Bay Area, developing a strong presence as both a performer and collaborator across a wide range of musical settings.
I am a graduate of Cabrillo College, where I earned an Associate’s Degree in Music as well as an Associate’s Degree in Science in Music Technology and Recording Arts. My background combines formal musical training with lots of hands-on experience in recording, production, and live performance.
In addition to performing and production, I offer music instruction and have been teaching since 2019. I am passionate about helping students grow their musical skills, confidence, and creativity through personalized, supportive instruction.

  <h2>Teaching</h2>
  <p>One of the biggest beliefs I have reagrding teaching is that in order for the student to succeed, the teacher must adapt to the student. That's the beauty of one on one lessons; you learn where the student thrives and where their faults are. As a team you work through how to make those faults their strong suits.
    When it comes to my system of teaching, I really love a good balance of warmups, theory, and making it fun so that it engages the student. Of course, depending on the student it may need some altering, but engagement for anyone learning anything is key..</p>
